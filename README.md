# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Prediction
Airline passenger satisfaction project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict and enhance passenger satisfaction in the airline industry. By
utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing various customer-related features, including travel class, type of travel, and in-flight service ratings, our
goal is to develop a predictive model that not only accurately forecasts customer satisfaction but also identifies key areas for service improvement.The
trained model is then applied to predict customer satisfaction, and insights
derived from the resulting confusion matrix guide recommendations for targeted service enhancements.By building model, we aim to categorize passengers as either ’satisfied’ or ’dissatisfied’ based on their travel experience.
This project contributes valuable insights to the airline industry, facilitating
data-driven decision-making to optimize the overall travel experience and
customer satisfaction. It helps to seeks airlines with actionable insights for
personalized and targeted improvements, contributing to a holistic understanding of customer preferences and expectations in the airline industry.
By harnessing the power of ML,airlines can create a more satisfying and
personalized experience for their passengers, leading to increased customer
loyalty and profitability

# About the Dataset
For this study, the raw data collected is obtained from the online resource
kaggle.c, which will be used to train machine learning models. The data is
originally available in English language, and it was obtained in the comma
separated values (CSV) format. The dataset consist of the feedback details of customer who have already flown with them. 
The dataset consists of the details of customers who have already flown with them. As this dataset is survey data,
some columns are Likert scale with rating od (1 to 5).
Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a unique passenger’s feedback, providing a comprehensive snapshot of their journey and satisfaction levels.
