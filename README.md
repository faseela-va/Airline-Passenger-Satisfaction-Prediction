# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Prediction
Airline passenger satisfaction project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict and enhance passenger satisfaction in the airline industry. By
utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing various customer-related features, including travel class, type of travel, and in-flight service ratings, our
goal is to develop a predictive model that not only accurately forecasts customer satisfaction but also identifies key areas for service improvement.The
trained model is then applied to predict customer satisfaction, and insights
derived from the resulting confusion matrix guide recommendations for targeted service enhancements.By building model, we aim to categorize passengers as either ’satisfied’ or ’dissatisfied’ based on their travel experience.
This project contributes valuable insights to the airline industry, facilitating
data-driven decision-making to optimize the overall travel experience and
customer satisfaction. It helps to seeks airlines with actionable insights for
personalized and targeted improvements, contributing to a holistic understanding of customer preferences and expectations in the airline industry.
By harnessing the power of ML,airlines can create a more satisfying and
personalized experience for their passengers, leading to increased customer
loyalty and profitability

# About the Dataset
For this study, the raw data collected is obtained from the online resource
kaggle.c, which will be used to train machine learning models. The data is
originally available in English language, and it was obtained in the comma
separated values (CSV) format. 

The dataset consist of the feedback details of customer who have already flown with them.The dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey, consisting of 129880 entries and 23 features. 
The dataset consists of the details of customers who have already flown with them. As this dataset is survey data,
some columns are Likert scale with rating od (1 to 5).
Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a unique passenger’s feedback, providing a comprehensive snapshot of their journey and satisfaction levels.

# Conclusion
In the culmination of our airline customer satisfaction prediction project, we
set out to harness the capabilities of the XGBoost algorithm to enhance the
understanding and anticipation of passenger contentment during air travel.

The analysis uncovered
the robustness of the XGBoost algorithm in accurately predicting customer
satisfaction outcomes based on a diverse set of relevant features.Throughout
the project, we encountered challenges related to data quality, ensuring completeness, and the necessity for robust preprocessing.

This model can be used to predict future airline passenger satisfaction by
airline companies.To maintain and improve customer satisfaction and customer retention my recommendation is to have top notch inflight entertainment. If technology is not already in place this may require some capital investment but it is the most important factor and it is probably easier and
cheaper to impove than seat comfort. Seat comfort is probably the most
difficult thing to manage as the buisness is trying to maximize the number
of passengers. However, perhaps improving materials the head rest or other
factors that do not require taking up more space may be worth exploring
for greater customer satisfaction. Ease of Online Booking is the least important of the top three factors and seems to be well regarded by passengers.

As we move forward, the outcomes of our project contribute to the broader
landscape of utilizing machine learning for predictive analytics in service sectors, fostering ongoing innovation and improvements in customer satisfaction
strategies.
