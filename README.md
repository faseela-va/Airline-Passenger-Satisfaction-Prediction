# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Prediction
Airline passenger satisfaction project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict and enhance passenger satisfaction in the airline industry. By
utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing various customer-related features, including travel class, type of travel, and in-flight service ratings, our
goal is to develop a predictive model that not only accurately forecasts customer satisfaction but also identifies key areas for service improvement.The
trained model is then applied to predict customer satisfaction, and insights
derived from the resulting confusion matrix guide recommendations for targeted service enhancements.By building model, we aim to categorize passengers as either ’satisfied’ or ’dissatisfied’ based on their travel experience.
This project contributes valuable insights to the airline industry, facilitating
data-driven decision-making to optimize the overall travel experience and
customer satisfaction. It helps to seeks airlines with actionable insights for
personalized and targeted improvements, contributing to a holistic understanding of customer preferences and expectations in the airline industry.
By harnessing the power of ML,airlines can create a more satisfying and
personalized experience for their passengers, leading to increased customer
loyalty and profitability
